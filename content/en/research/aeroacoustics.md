Flow oscillations play an important role in aeroacoustics. In such cases, the movement of the air is accompanied by a significant sound emission, which is sometimes desirable but can also be unwanted. Our research group investigates flows falling into both categories. We work on modeling wind instruments such as organ pipes and recorders as well as on cavity tone, which is a prototypical flow configuration of sound generation at the gaps of vehicles. 

Using methods to assess the stability of the flow, we developed new models to describe aeroacoustic oscillations. Furthermore, we created models to better understand the relationship between the acoustic and aerodynamic fields.
