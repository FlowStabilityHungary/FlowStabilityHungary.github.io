The edge tone is one of the simplest aeroacoustic configurations. It consists of a plane jet opposite to a wedge. The jet oscillates with well-defined frequencies as it impinges the wedge, and can also produce sound. This is the same mechanism that is responsible for the sound generation in flue instruments (recorders, organ pipes). Modelling of such phenomena is quite challenging. The aeroacoustic and hydrodynamic fields are strongly coupled, and these require a completely different setup in simulations. The characteristic length of the hydrodynamic field is much smaller than that of the acoustic field, and this separation of scales results in a high computational cost. 
The research topic approaches the above problem using reduced-order models (ROMs). Using separate simulations for the hydrodynamic and acoustic fields and extracting models of a few degrees of freedom for each, we aim at coupling the simplified models. These models would yield a deeper understanding of the underlying physics and would also allow us to synthesize and develop better instruments.
