Cavity tone is one of the simplest aeroacoustic configurations. The flow above a cavity creates a shear layer that is unstable and tends to oscillate. The oscillating shear layer is coupled to the cavity, which acts as a resonator. This can result in unwanted noise that can usually be prevented. This is the mechanism that is responsible for the noise in vehicles. However, modeling the phenomenon is really challenging. The aeroacoustic and hydrodynamic fields are strongly coupled, while these require a completely different setup in simulations. The characteristic length of the hydrodynamic field is much smaller than that of the acoustic field, and this separation of scales results in a high computational cost. 
The research topic approaches the above problem using reduced-order models (ROMs). Using separate simulations for the hydrodynamic and acoustic fields and extracting a few degrees of freedom models for each, we aim to couple the simplified models. These models would yield a deeper understanding of the underlying physics and would allow us to synthesise and develop better instruments.
