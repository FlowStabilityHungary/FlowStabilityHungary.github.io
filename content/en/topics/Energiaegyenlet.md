Prediction of turbulence is one of the most challenging problems in fluid mechanics, especially in a strong external disturbance environment. The motivation of this topic is that as turbulence can significantly affect flow losses and transport phenomena, prediction of it would have a lot of practical applications. Our research group works on developing and improvement techniques to predict the development of turbulence.
