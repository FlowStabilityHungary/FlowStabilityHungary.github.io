A key topic of fluid mechanics is that surface roughness with a height of 10-100 μm significantly affects flow losses. Irregular roughness increases the loss, but streamwise elongated riblets decrease it. However, such a fine resolution in CFD simulations is not feasible. In this project, we substitute the effect of roughness with an impedance model, for which instead of the regular in-time Fourier transform, a spatial Fourier transformation is utilized.   

If you are interested in this topic, write to Dr. Péter Tamás Nagy.
