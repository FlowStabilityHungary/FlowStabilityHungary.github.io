In liquids, the laminar-turbulent transition can be delayed, which can reduce the flow losses. The topic aims at more sophisticated modelling and design of elastic coatings than in previous studies. The goal is to design a coating that can delay laminar-turbulent transition regardless of the free-stream turbulence level.
