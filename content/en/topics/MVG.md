Vortex generators are tipically used to delay separation, thereby reducing the profile drag. Recent studies have shown both theoretically and experimentally that properly designed vortex generators can delay the laminar-turbulent transitions, and reduce the friction drag significantly. We are working on designing such miniature vortex generators within the framework of several research funds. 

If you are interested in this topic, write to Dr. Péter Tamás Nagy.
