Thus, much more energy is needed to move a vehicle in the surrounding fluid in the presence of the instability waves.</description></item><item><title>Aeroacoustics</title><link>FlowStabilityHungary.github.io/en/research/aeroacoustics/</link><pubDate>Mon, 23 Dec 2019 15:44:46 +0600</pubDate><guid>FlowStabilityHungary.github.io/en/research/aeroacoustics/</guid><description>Flow oscillations play an important role in aeroacoustics. In such cases, the movement of the air is accompanied by a significant sound emission, which is sometimes desirable but can also be unwanted.</description></item></channel></rss>
